## How It Works

1. Enter one or more hashtags separated by commas
2. The extension opens background tabs to check each hashtag on LinkedIn
3. Follower counts for each hashtag are displayed in a table
4. Related hashtags are suggested based on:
   - Relevance to your entered keywords (30% of score)
   - Follower counts (70% of score)
   - Category and industry associations

## Suggestion Categories

The extension organizes hashtag suggestions into helpful categories:

- **High-Impact Hashtags**: 1M+ followers, providing maximum visibility
- **Growing Hashtags**: 100K-1M followers, offering strong reach with targeted audiences
- **Moderate Hashtags**: 10K-100K followers, good for niche topics with engaged communities
- **Niche Hashtags**: Under 10K followers, specialized communities with high engagement

## Technical Details

The extension uses multiple sophisticated methods to extract and analyze hashtag data:

1. **Content Analysis**: Scans LinkedIn posts and content for hashtag mentions
2. **Sidebar Extraction**: Finds related hashtags from LinkedIn's recommendation sections
3. **Link Pattern Recognition**: Identifies hashtag relationships in LinkedIn's page structure
4. **HTML Pattern Matching**: Uses regex and pattern matching to identify hashtag connections
5. **Intelligent Fallback System**: Provides industry-relevant suggestions even when direct extraction fails
6. **Local Storage**: Saves search history and results for persistent access across browser sessions

### Storage Layout

The extension stores data under two keys in Chrome's local storage:

```
hashtagResults = {
  [hashtag]: {
    followers: "1,234 followers",
    lastChecked: "2024-05-01T12:00:00Z"
  }
}

searchHistory = [
  {
    query: "tag1, tag2",
    hashtags: ["tag1", "tag2"],
    suggestedHashtags: ["related1", "related2"],
    timestamp: "2024-05-01T12:00:00Z"
  }
]
```

Each search references hashtags by name. Follower counts and the last time a hashtag was checked are stored once in `hashtagResults`.

## Auto Commenter Setup

The auto commenter feature requires an OpenAI API key to function:

1. Go to [OpenAI's platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and create an API key
2. In the extension popup, click on the "Auto Commenter" tab
3. Enter your API key in the designated field
4. Customize your signature that will be added to each comment
5. Adjust the comment frequency to control how often the AI comments on posts
6. Configure visual content analysis options:
   - Image Analysis: Enable to improve comments on posts containing images
   - Video Analysis: Enable to generate better responses to video content (experimental)
7. Click "Save Settings" to apply your configuration
8. Your API key is stored encrypted in Chrome sync storage and only kept in memory when commenting

Once active on LinkedIn, you'll see a status icon (ðŸ“Š) positioned above the chat button in the bottom-right corner that shows real-time information about:
- Posts being evaluated
- Comment generation process
- API responses
- Successful/failed comments
- Auto-scrolling activity

This status display helps you monitor what the auto-commenter is doing and diagnose any issues that may arise.

### Comment Statistics

- View total comments posted
